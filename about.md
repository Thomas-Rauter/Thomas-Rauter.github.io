# About Me

Hello, I’m **Thomas Rauter**, a PhD researcher in **Bioinformatics** at the University of Salzburg.
My PhD focuses on statistical evaluation of time-series omics data, CHO cell modeling, and 
interpretable deep learning for molecular networks.

## Background

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology from Graz and a master’s degree in Biotechnology, 
where I developed a strong interest in computational methods, particularly machine learning.
This passion led me to specialize in bioinformatics for my PhD research.

## Current Work

As part of my PhD, I aim to:
- Develop statistical methods for analyzing time-series omics data.
- Build interpretable machine learning models for molecular networks.
- Model CHO cells to improve biotechnological processes.

## My Goal: Becoming a Full-Stack Data Scientist

My ultimate goal is to become a **full-stack data scientist**, a role that encompasses not only 
developing machine learning models but also deploying them into production and monitoring them, to 
deliver real-world value. 

A full-stack data scientist bridges the gap between model development and its practical application.
While I love programming, machine learning, and data science, I believe that the true value comes 
from delivering functional solutions that directly impact the business. 

A model in a Jupyter notebook, no matter how sophisticated, cannot provide value to a company on its
own. Deployed models, integrated into systems and accessible to end-users, are what drive 
decision-making and innovation. This is why I am passionate about mastering the entire lifecycle of
data science projects, from exploration and modeling to deployment and maintenance.

## Skills and Interests

- **Programming**: Proficient in Python and R for data analysis and modeling.
- **Machine Learning**: Focus on interpretable AI and applications in bioinformatics.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating effective and insightful visualizations.
- **Research**: Exploring innovative methods to address complex biological questions.
