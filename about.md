# About Me

Hello, I’m **Thomas Rauter**, a PhD researcher in **Bioinformatics** at the University of Salzburg.
My PhD focuses on statistical evaluation of time-series omics data, CHO cell modeling, and 
interpretable deep learning for molecular networks.

## Background

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology from Graz and a master’s degree in Biotechnology, 
where I developed a strong interest in computational methods and statistics.
This passion led me to specialize in bioinformatics for my PhD research.

## Current Work

As part of my PhD, I aim to:
- Develop statistical methods for analyzing time-series omics data.
- Build interpretable machine learning models for molecular networks.
- Model CHO cells to improve biotechnological processes.


## Strenghts

- **Autodidactic Learning**: I have a proven ability to teach myself complex 
  technical topics through independent study. With a formal background in 
  biology, I transitioned into bioinformatics without relying on additional 
  university coursework. By leveraging online resources, technical 
  documentation, and hands-on experimentation, I developed expertise in  
  statistical modeling, data analysis, and machine learning using Python and 
  R. This self-directed approach allows me to efficiently master new tools 
  and concepts in fast-evolving domains.
- **Structured Thinking**: I’m highly organized by nature—whether it’s my desk,
  desktop, phone, browser tabs, emails, or codebase, everything is 
  intuitively named, neatly arranged, and well-documented. I use to-do lists 
  extensively and rarely lose track of data or files. This structure isn’t 
  just a habit—it’s a conscious strategy. Long-term projects live or die by 
  their organization, and I make sure mine stay alive.
- **Patience**: Structured work over time requires patience, and I’ve always had
  a strong sense of that. Progress in research is often slow 
  and incremental, so staying focused on the bigger picture is essential.
- **Creativity**: I tend to think in unconventional ways, which often leads to 
  efficient or elegant solutions. For example, back in school, I’d sometimes 
  forget the "proper" formulas for math problems but still solve them using 
  graphical reasoning or approximation. That mindset stuck—I look for insight,
  not just instructions.

## Where I am improving

- **Prioritization**: I sometimes gravitate toward tasks I find interesting, 
  even when they aren’t the most urgent. This can delay higher-priority work. 
  I’ve become more aware of this tendency and am now building routines that help
  me stay aligned with what matters most to the project—without losing the drive
  for exploration.
- **Focus**: I can get distracted by noise and interruptions, especially in 
  shared office environments. To counter this, I use earplugs, limit 
  notifications, and set clear focus blocks to stay fully immersed in one task 
  at a time.

## Hardskills

### Python programming

Whenever I work with machine learning, I use Python as the to go language 
for that. Further, I wrote a Python package that allows to train a special 
type of interpretable neural network that has the architecture of a 
molecular network (not yet made available publicly at the time of writing this).

### R programming

R is the number one language in bioinformatics and therefore I use it a lot 
in my daily work. I did a multitude of statistical analyses with it, and 
also wrote an R package, SplineOmics (see section:  software-packages).


## Softskills

### Presenting

**Overview:**  
Presenting results and topics is a key skill when someone pursues a scientific 
education. Since highschool, I had to make many different presentations, which 
includes more formal ones at seminars and conferences, but also more informal 
ones in group meetings. I can say with confidence that over the years I 
became a very good presenter, when I have the time to sufficiently prepare.
