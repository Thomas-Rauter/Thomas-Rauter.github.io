## Presenting

**Overview:**  
Presenting results and topics is a key skill when someone pursues a scientific education. Since highschool, I had to make many different presentations, which includes more formal ones at seminars and conferences, but also more informal ones in group meetings

**Key Strengths:**  
- Clear story
- No clutter and information overload
- Clear structure: Introduction, methods, results and discussion, summary, conclusions, (and outlook)

**Use Cases:**  
- Seminars
- Conferences
- Group meetings
- Classes
