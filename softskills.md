Welcome to the softskills section of my portfolio. Here, I list the softskills I have aquired actively or passively throughout my professional journey.

## Presenting

**Overview:**  
Presenting results and topics is a key skill when someone pursues a scientific 
education. Since highschool, I had to make many different presentations, which 
includes more formal ones at seminars and conferences, but also more informal 
ones in group meetings. I can say with confidence that over the years I 
became a very good presenter, when I have the time to sufficiently prepare.
