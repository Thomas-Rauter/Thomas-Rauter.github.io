Hello, Iâ€™m **Thomas Rauter**, currently a PhD researcher in **Bioinformatics** at the 
Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg, Austria. This website is my 
professional portfolio, where I share my work, achievements, and ongoing projects.

<div class="note">
While much of the information here is also available on my 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-rauter-003583281), this website presents it in a more
organized and structured way. It is designed to be a central hub for my professional journey, 
offering a comprehensive overview that is easy to navigate.

## My Goal
My goal is to become a **full-stack data scientist** working in industry, combining model 
development, deployment, and monitoring to deliver real-world value. 

To learn more about why this is my goal and what it means to me, visit the [About Me](about-me) 
page.

## Technology Badges
Throughout this website, you will see badges like 
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-yellow?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white). These
badges represent the specific technologies I used in each project, providing a quick and visual way
to understand the tools and frameworks that were applied.
