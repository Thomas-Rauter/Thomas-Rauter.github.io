Hello, I’m **Thomas Rauter**, a PhD researcher in **Bioinformatics**. This website is my 
professional portfolio, where I share my work, achievements, and ongoing projects in data 
science and bioinformatics.

## Explore My Work
Here’s what you can find here:
- My journey through **Data Science Challenges**, including the award-winning LEC Data Challenge 2023.
- Insights into **Software Packages** I’ve developed, like SplineOmics, an R package for analyzing time-series omics data.
- A collection of **Data Science Ebooks**  I’ve authored.

## Stay Updated
In my PhD, I am currently focused on:
- Developing interpretable deep learning models based on molecular networks.
- Exploring innovative methods for CHO cell modeling.
