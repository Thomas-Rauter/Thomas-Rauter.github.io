# Hardskills

Welcome to the hardskills section of my portfolio. This is where I list the 
concrete technical skills I've built. Unlike soft skills, these are measurable 
and testable.

## Python programming

Whenever I work with machine learning, I use Python as the to go language 
for that. Further, I wrote a Python package that allows to train a special 
type of interpretable neural network that has the architecture of a 
molecular network (not yet made available publicly at the time of writing this).

## R programming

R is the number one language in bioinformatics and therefore I use it a lot 
in my daily work. I did a multitude of statistical analyses with it, and 
also wrote an R package, SplineOmics (see section:  software-packages).
