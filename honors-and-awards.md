## DOC Fund of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW)

I received a DOC Fellowship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), a
highly competitive grant supporting outstanding PhD students across all research
disciplines. The fellowship is awarded based on academic performance, research
potential, and project quality. I secured €147,240 in total funding, with
€49,080 allocated for my personal research support over three years, based
on my independently proposed research project.
