# Courses and Books

Welcome to the courses and books section of my portfolio. Here, I share the 
educational programs I have completed and the books I have studied to expand my
professional skills. These courses and books complement my formal university 
education, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning beyond academia.

**Overview**  
This course covered the four key stages of a machine learning project: Scoping, Data, Modeling, and Deployment, with a strong focus on practical guidelines for real-world applications.

- Scoping: Strategies for identifying impactful, addressable problems that drive business value.  
- Data: Ensuring high-quality data through label consistency, data augmentation, feature engineering, and proper train/dev/test splits.  
- Modeling: Establishing strong baselines, conducting error analysis, and auditing model performance.  
- Deployment: Managing data and concept drift, implementing deployment patterns, and setting up effective monitoring systems.

### **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
> **by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online, USA**  
> *February 2023*

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-yellow?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/NumPy-blue?style=flat&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-orange?style=flat&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)  

**Skills**: Linear and logistic regression, machine learning basics;

[Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v43qF1up75rKR2wHzzkab3rrM1bkY5xq/view?usp=sharing)

**Overview**  
This course began with linear regression as a fundamental example of regression,
followed by logistic regression as an introduction to classification. Along the
way, key machine learning concepts were covered, including bias-variance 
tradeoff, dataset splitting (train/dev/test sets), and other foundational
principles essential for building and evaluating models.

### **Introduction to Statistics**
> **by David Lane, Rice University, USA**  

**Skills**: distributions, probability, estimation, hypothesis testing, power,
regression, transformations, chi square, effect size, research design, etc.;

[Link to the ebook](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/introduction-to-statistics)

**Overview**  
I spent many hours deeply engaging with this book, which covers all fundamental
topics in statistics, from graphing and summarizing distributions to 
probability, hypothesis testing, regression, and ANOVA. Working through each 
chapter strengthened my intuition for statistical concepts, giving me a solid 
foundation for data analysis, experimental design, and statistical inference.

### **Learn Data Mining Through Excel**
> **by Hong Zhou, University of Saint Joseph, USA**  

**Skills**: machine learning algorithms;

[Link to the ebook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9771-1)

**Overview**  
This ebook provided a hands-on approach to data mining by implementing 
algorithms
manually in Excel, forcing me to break down each step and truly understand their
mechanics. Unlike automated tools, Excel makes every calculation visible, 
reinforcing intuition for methods like linear and logistic regression, decision 
trees, neural networks, k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes, sentence sentiment analysis, and 
more.
