# Courses and Books

Welcome to the courses and books section of my portfolio. Here, I share the 
educational programs I have completed and the books I have studied to expand my
professional skills. While I completed many different courses throughout my 
professional journey (for example as part of my Bachelor's and Master's 
degrees) here I want to focus on those that are relevant for data science.


## Courses, Self-Directed Learning

## Courses, Academia

I completed the following courses as part of my PhD program:


---
<br>

### **Elementary Data Mining**
> **by Dr. Christian Borgelt, Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg, Austria**  
> *March - June 2025*

**Skills**: Theoretic understanding of the data mining process, kNN, Naive 
Bayes;

**Overview**  
The Elementary Data Mining lecture provides a foundational overview of 
extracting meaningful knowledge from data. It covers the full Knowledge 
Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, from understanding data to building 
predictive models. Core modeling principles are introduced, including model 
classes, fitting techniques, error sources, and validation strategies.  
Students  learn key algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors, decision and  
regression trees, and Bayesian classifiers (naive, Gaussian, and 
tree-extended).  Additionally, the course introduces unsupervised learning 
through basic clustering methods, including k-means and hierarchical 
clustering, equipping students with a broad toolkit for data-driven analysis.

### **Probability Theory**
> **by Prof. Arne Bathke, Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg, Austria**  
> *March - June 2025*

**Skills**: Theoretic understanding of probability theory, approaches to 
solve probability problems;

**Overview**  
Introduction to elementary methods of stochastics and probability theory  
with a  strong emphasis on modeling. Discrete and continuous models, random 
variables, distributions, expected value, variance, moments, conditional 
probabilities, independence, important inequalities, convergences, and limit 
theorems.

<br>

### **Exercises for Probability Theory**
> **by Jonas Beck, Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg, Austria**  
> *March - June 2025*

**Skills**: Ability to solve probability problems;

**Overview**  
Exercises to the lecture "Probability Theory" held by Arne Bathke, described 
above.

### **Programming with Perl**
> **by Prof. Leila Taher, TU Graz, Austria**  
> *March - June 2023*

![Perl](https://img.shields.io/badge/Perl-%2339457E?style=flat&logo=perl&logoColor=white)

**Skills**: Perl programming;

**Overview**  
In the beginner's Perl course I took, I learned the core concepts of 
programming through Perl’s syntax and unique strengths. I started with the 
basics—variables, data types, and input/output—before moving on to control 
structures like loops and conditionals. One of the most interesting parts
was  working with regular expressions, which allowed me to efficiently 
search,  match, and manipulate text. I also got hands-on experience writing 
functions, subroutines, organizing code into packages, and using modules, 
which  taught me  how to structure more complex and reusable scripts. 
Overall, the course gave me a solid grasp of both Perl and essential 
programming principles.

**Skills**: machine learning, error analysis, project structuring, performance
benchmarking, data strategy development;

[Link to the ebook](https://info.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning-book)

**Overview**  
This ebook is like a guidebook for planning and improving machine learning  
projects. Instead of focusing on the math or code, it teaches you how to  
think  about building AI systems—like choosing the right data, figuring out
