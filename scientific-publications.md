**Abstract**  
Existing plasmid systems offer a fundamental foundation for gene expression in *Cupriavidus necator*; however, their applicability is constrained by the limitations of conjugation. Low segregational stabilities and plasmid copy numbers, particularly in the absence of selection pressure, pose challenges. Phytases, recognized for their widespread application as supplements in animal feed to enhance phosphate availability, present an intriguing prospect for heterologous production in *C. necator*. The establishment of stable, high-copy number plasmids that can be electroporated would support the utilization of *C. necator* for the production of single-cell protein from CO2.
