**Overview**  
An R package for finding significant features (hits) in time-series -omics data using splines and limma for hypothesis testing. It clusters hits based on spline shape and generates summary HTML reports.

# Honors and Awards

Welcome to the honors and awards section of my portfolio. Here, I list 
achievements like grants, fellowships, scholarships, etc.

## DOC Fund of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW)

I received a DOC Fellowship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW), a
highly competitive grant supporting outstanding PhD students across all research
disciplines. The fellowship is awarded based on academic performance, research
potential, and project quality. I secured €147,240 in total funding, with
€49,080 allocated for my personal research support over three years, based
on my independently proposed research project.

# Self Written Data Science Ebooks

I have authored the following ebooks:

## **Navigating Machine Learning Projects**  
[Read the ebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gsadWAoJVJbfgRQjI2te6q_nKDomsh2B/view?usp=sharing)

**Overview**  
On the internet, there are lots of different resources explaining HOW different 
things in machine learning work, such as the technical details of neural  
networks. However, resources about how to navigate machine learning projects 
are much rarer. Few people discuss WHEN to for example apply neural networks,
or what to do when your choosen model does not perform well enough. This is 
the gap I wanted to fill with this ebook. It gives you an overview of 
different techniques, methods, models, etc. that exist, and tells you when to 
use them. This can be considered as the art of machine learning, since it is 
mostly based on experience of successful practitioners, such as Andrew Ng, 
Andriy Burkov, and others. In this book, I compiled the experience from 
those people that they shared over their books or online courses.

## **Organising Machine Learning Projects**  
[Read the ebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YsUmuU8WYK_sVuVmge58oywHpaiNdQG3/view?usp=sharing)

**Overview**  
A guide on how to organise machine learning projects, covering environment 
and dependency management, best practices for Git commits, documentation in 
ML projects, experiment logging and tracking, dataset versioning, and model 
storage and versioning. I think many of the things written down in the book 
seem obvious and clear, but I know from experience that many projects in the 
end still fall short on several of those things. Therefore, I think it is 
very useful to have those strategies and best practices written down, to 
revise them regularly and allow for sharing with team members to standardize 
the organisation and documentation within a project.
