**Abstract**  
Existing plasmid systems offer a fundamental foundation for gene expression
in *Cupriavidus necator*; however, their applicability is constrained by the
limitations of conjugation. Low segregational stabilities and plasmid copy
numbers, particularly in the absence of selection pressure, pose challenges.
Phytases, recognized for their widespread application as supplements in animal
feed to enhance phosphate availability, present an intriguing prospect for
heterologous production in *C. necator*. The establishment of stable, high-copy
number plasmids that can be electroporated would support the utilization of
*C. necator* for the production of single-cell protein from CO2.
