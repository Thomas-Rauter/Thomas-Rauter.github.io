# Data Science Challenges

Data science challenges are competitive events where individuals or teams work on real-world 
problems using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Below are challenges I participated in
together with a team:

## **Watt's up? Synthetic Data for Buildings**

### üèÜ **3rd Place / 8 Teams ‚Äì 80‚Ç¨ Prize**

**Overview**  
The task was to develop a model that can input timecourse data of electricity
consumption and output a synthetic version of this dataset that ensures the
privacy of the individuals. This is important because electricity consumption
data are sensitive and cannot be easily shared. However, widespread availability
of such datasets could be very beneficial for model development, allowing insights
that help save energy.

**Approach**  
We chose an approach that samples pieces from the actual data, reassembles them,
and adds Gaussian noise on top. This produced instances that closely resembled
the real data in terms of statistical properties but were different enough to
ensure they cannot be linked to individual examples of the real data.

**Overview**  
Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy 
cells, disrupting the body‚Äôs natural defense mechanisms. These diseases affect 
50 million people in the U.S., with cases rising globally.
One of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases is inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). To better understand and treat IBD, researchers sequence the RNA 
(transcriptome) of individual affected cells. However, this process is highly 
complex and expensive, making a predictive model for transcriptomics a valuable
tool in advancing research.
This challenge consisted of three independent sub-challenges, each addressing a
distinct aspect of this broader research problem:
- The task of Part 1 of this challenge was to 
  create a model that can deliver this expensive and hard to obtain 
  information from readily available pathology images.
- The task of Part 2 was to predict all genes of a cell from a (predicted) 
  subpart.
- The task of Part 3 was to rank all genes based on their ability to 
  distinguish between normal cells and ones showing dysplasia. 

**Approach**  
For task 1, we used the ResNet50 model implemented in PyTorch to directly  
map from the input images to the 460 genes (end-to-end deep learning approach).

For task 2, we took our trained ResNet50 model and its predictions, which 
served as the input to a standard neural network, which mapped from the 460 
predicted genes to all genes of the cell.

For task 3, we submitted many different approaches. Notable examples include
(i) determining the AUC value for all features, and sorting them according to 
that, and (ii) predicting the cells with dysplasia with the help of a neural 
network model, for which we extracted feature importances with the 
Integrated Gradients method from the Captum library. Integrated Gradients is 
a feature importance algorithm for neural networks.

### üèÜ **1st Place / 46 Teams ‚Äì 4,000‚Ç¨ Prize**

**Overview**  
The task was to develop a machine learning solution to identify 
cylinder-specific events in time-series data from large combustion engines.

**Approach**  
We trained an XGBoost algorithm to produce a model that predicted, for each  
time point, which type of issue was present, if any. As input, we used slices  
of the time course (nearest values in time). Because issues always covered  
larger continuous time windows in the training data, we afterward  
algorithmically identified regions in the XGBoost predictions where many 
issues were detected and unified them into a continuous stretch with one 
issue type.

## **Trigger Detection Challenge 2023**

**Overview**  
A multi-label classification challenge to assign trigger warning
labels (such as violence and blood) to fanfiction documents based on their 
content.  
As I still was a beginner, I honestly was a bit overwhelmed and left the 
challenge before it ended. However, I learned a lot about the workflow on how 
to tackle such tasks.
