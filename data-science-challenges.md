# Data Science Challenges

A collection of challenges I've participated in:

- **Trigger Detection Challenge 2023**: Participated in a multi-label classification challenge to assign trigger warning labels to fanfiction documents based on their content. As this was my first challenge, I was still inexperienced and did not make a major contribution to our team.

- **LEC Data Challenge 2023**: Developed a machine learning solution to identify cylinder-specific events in time-series data from large engines, focusing on accurate classification and temporal precision. Our team secured **1st place** and won â‚¬4,000.
