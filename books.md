Welcome to the books section of my portfolio. Here, I list the books I have 
studied to expand my professional skills.

## **Modeling Mindsets**
> **by Christoph Molnar, Germany, published 2022**  

**Skills**: Frequentist and Bayesian statistics, causal inference, supervised unsupervised reinforcement machine learning, deep learning;

**Overview**  
This book discussed the idea of viewing modeling not in terms of the algorithms/model classes, like linear regression, but in terms of mindsets. Depending on the mindset, different conclusions can be drawn from the model and different outcomes achieved. For example, when linear regression is used with the Frequentist mindset, the focus is on hypothesis testing with the help of the parameter values, and the outcomes are p-values and confidence intervals. On the other hand, when the same algorithm is used with a supervised machine learning mindset, the focus is on the prediction performance on holdout test data.

## **Machine Learning Yearning**
> **by Andrew Ng, USA, published 2018**  

**Skills**: machine learning, error analysis, project structuring, performance
benchmarking, data strategy development;

**Overview**  
This ebook is like a guidebook for planning and improving machine learning  
projects. Instead of focusing on the math or code, it teaches you how to  
think  about building AI systems—like choosing the right data, figuring out 
what's going wrong, and deciding what to fix first. It's about making smart 
decisions to help your machine learning models work better in the real world.

## **Machine Learning Engineering**
> **by Andriy Burkov, Canada, published 2020**  

**Skills**: machine learning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment and 
monitoring;

**Overview**  
This ebook focuses on navigating machine learning projects, from best practices
of how to split the data, how to get great features, to choosing appropriate 
models for the given problems, and more. This book gave me very valuable 
information of what can be called the art of machine learning.

## **Introduction to Statistics**
> **by David Lane, Rice University, USA, published 2003**  

**Skills**: distributions, probability, estimation, hypothesis testing, power,
regression, transformations, chi square, effect size, research design, etc.;

[Link to the ebook](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/introduction-to-statistics)

**Overview**  
I spent many hours deeply engaging with this book, which covers all fundamental
topics in statistics, from graphing and summarizing distributions to 
probability, hypothesis testing, regression, and ANOVA. Working through each 
chapter strengthened my intuition for statistical concepts, giving me a solid 
foundation for data analysis, experimental design, and statistical inference.

## **Learn Data Mining Through Excel**
> **by Hong Zhou, University of Saint Joseph, USA, published 2023**  

**Skills**: machine learning algorithms;

[Link to the ebook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9771-1)

**Overview**  
This ebook provided a hands-on approach to data mining by implementing 
algorithms
manually in Excel, forcing me to break down each step and truly understand their
mechanics. Unlike automated tools, Excel makes every calculation visible, 
reinforcing intuition for methods like linear and logistic regression, decision 
trees, neural networks, k-NN, Naïve Bayes, sentence sentiment analysis, and 
more.
