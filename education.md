## PhD Bioinformatics
> **Paris Lodron University of Salzburg, Austria**  
> *February 2024 - today*

**Overview**  
In my PhD, I am responsible for data analysis and modeling within our research
consortium, where we study the glycosylation of the NISTmAb antibody produced in
NISTCHO cells. Additionally, I pursue an own project, where I work in
interpretable deep learning. I work in the 
[research group of Prof. Nikolaus Fortelny](https://www.plus.ac.at/biowissenschaften/der-fachbereich/arbeitsgruppen/fortelny/)

Grade Average: 1.22 (Graduated with Honors)

**Overview**  
During my Master’s in Biotechnology, I specialized in molecular biotechnology, 
bioinformatics, and bioprocess technology. I gained expertise in cell, protein,
and metabolic engineering, as well as computational analysis of DNA and protein
sequences. The curriculum also covered environmental and food biotechnology, 
focusing on microbial and enzymatic processes in food production. Additionally, 
I conducted hands-on laboratory research under the guidance of experienced
scientists, further developing my experimental and analytical skills.

For my Master’s thesis in Bioinformatics, I benchmarked software tools for DNA 
analysis, evaluating their performance and accuracy in finding so called
structural variants in long DNA reads.

## Natural Science Highschool Albert Einstein
> **Meran, Italy**  
> *September 2012 - June 2017*

Final Score: 85/100

**Overview**  
I attended a natural science high school, where the curriculum focused on
mathematics, physics, informatics, and natural sciences. In addition to these 
core subjects, I gained a foundation in law and business, as well as 
multilingual proficiency through courses in German, English, and Italian. This
diverse education provided me with strong analytical skills and a broad academic
background.
